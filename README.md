### Key Features

- **Intelligent AI Opponent**: Three difficulty levels with strategic gameplay
- **Persistent Game State**: Automatic save/load functionality using localStorage
- **Accessibility Support**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for moves and game outcomes
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent scoring across multiple games
- **Undo Functionality**: Take back your last move(s)
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility option
- **Touch Support**: Optimized for mobile devices

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

### Basic Rules
1. You play as **X**, the computer plays as **O**
2. Players take turns placing their symbol on a 3√ó3 grid
3. First to get three symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, it's a draw

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Click on any empty cell to place your X
- **Keyboard**: Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter/Space to place your symbol
- **Touch**: Tap on empty cells (mobile devices)

### Game Options
- **New Game**: Reset the current game board
- **Difficulty**: Choose Easy, Medium, or Hard AI opponent
- **Undo**: Take back your last move (removes both your move and computer's response)
- **Audio Toggle**: Enable/disable sound effects
- **High Contrast**: Toggle high contrast mode for better visibility

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Computer makes random moves
- **Medium**: Computer uses strategy 70% of the time, random moves 30%
- **Hard**: Computer always uses optimal strategy (nearly unbeatable)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with accessibility attributes
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox, grid, and custom properties
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries required

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari 12+, Chrome Mobile 60+)

### Performance Features
- Efficient DOM manipulation with minimal reflows
- Optimized event handling with event delegation where appropriate
- Lazy loading of audio resources
- Responsive design without heavy CSS frameworks

### Core Components

#### Game State Management
```
const gameState = {
    currentPlayer: 'X',           // Current turn ('X' or 'O')
    board: Array(9).fill(''),     // Game board state
    gameActive: true,             // Whether game is in progress
    difficulty: 1,                // AI difficulty level (1-3)
    scores: { ... },              // Score tracking
    winningCombinations: [...],   // Win condition patterns
    winningLine: null,            // Indices of winning combination
    movesHistory: []              // Move history for undo functionality
}
```

#### Key Functions

**Game Logic**
- `initializeGame()`: Sets up game event listeners and UI
- `handleCellClick()`: Processes player moves
- `makeComputerMove()`: AI decision making
- `checkGameStatus()`: Win/draw detection
- `makeMove()`: Universal move handler

**AI Strategy**
- `makeRandomMove()`: Random cell selection (Easy mode)
- `makeStrategicMove()`: Strategic AI with win/block detection (Medium/Hard)
- `checkWinner()`: Utility function for AI decision making

**User Interface**
- `updateUI()`: Refreshes all visual elements
- `updateCell()`: Updates individual cell display
- `updateScoreDisplay()`: Updates score counters

**Persistence**
- `saveGameState()`: Stores game state to localStorage
- `loadGameState()`: Restores game state from localStorage

**Accessibility**
- `setupKeyboardNavigation()`: Arrow key and Enter support
- `setupHighContrastMode()`: Visual accessibility option

### AI Algorithm Details

The computer opponent uses a strategic algorithm in Medium and Hard modes:

1. **Win Detection**: If the computer can win on this turn, it does
2. **Block Detection**: If the player can win on their next turn, block them
3. **Center Control**: Take the center square if available
4. **Corner Strategy**: Prefer corners over edges
5. **Fallback**: Random move if no strategic option exists

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions

**State Management**: Used a centralized `gameState` object to maintain all game data, making debugging and persistence straightforward.

**Event Handling**: Implemented proper event delegation and cleanup to prevent memory leaks during game resets.

**AI Implementation**: Chose a rule-based approach over minimax for better performance and easier difficulty scaling.

**Persistence Strategy**: localStorage provides seamless save/restore without requiring a backend.

### Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Audio Autoplay**: Some browsers block audio autoplay; user interaction may be required
2. **localStorage Limits**: Game state is lost if user clears browser data
3. **AI Predictability**: Hard mode AI is deterministic (same position = same move)

### Browser Storage Usage

The game uses localStorage to persist:
- Current game board state
- Score history
- User preferences (audio, contrast, difficulty)
- Game settings and configuration

**Storage Keys Used:**
- `ticTacToeState`: Main game state
- `ticTacToeAudio`: Audio preference
- `ticTacToeContrast`: Contrast mode setting

### Performance Considerations

- **DOM Updates**: Minimal DOM manipulation with batch updates
- **Memory Management**: Event listeners properly cleaned up on reset
- **Audio Loading**: Sounds loaded on demand to reduce initial load time
- **Responsive Images**: No images used to minimize load time

### Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Labels**: All interactive elements properly labeled
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full game playability without mouse
- **Screen Reader Support**: Live regions for status updates
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visual accessibility
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling during keyboard navigation

### Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Multiplayer Mode**: Local two-player option
2. **Online Play**: WebSocket-based multiplayer
3. **Game Analytics**: Move pattern analysis and statistics
4. **Themes**: Multiple visual themes and color schemes
5. **Tournament Mode**: Multiple games with bracket-style progression
6. **AI Personality**: Different computer opponents with unique strategies
7. **Animated Moves**: Smooth transitions and move animations
8. **Game History**: Detailed move-by-move game replay

### Testing Recommendations

- Test across different screen sizes and orientations
- Verify keyboard navigation works completely
- Test audio functionality across browsers
- Validate localStorage persistence
- Test undo functionality in various game states
- Verify AI behavior at each difficulty level

### Contributing

When modifying this code:
1. Maintain the centralized state management pattern
2. Preserve accessibility features
3. Test across multiple devices and browsers
4. Ensure localStorage operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks
5. Maintain backward compatibility for saved game states
